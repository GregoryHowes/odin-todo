# odin-todo
The Odin Project ToDo project contained within the JavaScript course.
Lots and lots to learn in this one!
- modules
- constructors or factories
- webpack (I'm still not exactly sure about what to do with it!)
- SOLID principles
- remembering how to use HTML and CSS - it's been quite a while
- and I'm sure lots more . . .
